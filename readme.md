## CheshireCat Component Picker Plugin

### Simple plugin for the CheshireCat AI framework to find a requested electrical component from a JSON database, called via API.

---

_This example is using a fake API, which is not optimized and would be unpratical to use in production._

_The database was made just for example and does not include all the informations per component, and it doesn't include all most used components._

---

Everything for running this and the API is included in the `compose.yml` file.
